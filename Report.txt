•	Project Report: Story Generation Using Seq2Seq Model with Attention
1. Introduction
The goal of this project is to build a story generation system using a sequence-sequence (Seq2Seq) model with an attention mechanism. The system takes a writing prompt as input and generates a coherent story as output. The project leverages deep learning techniques, specifically Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and is implemented using TensorFlow and Keras. A Flask API is also developed to expose the model's functionality for real-time story generation.
2. Problem Statement
Generating creative and coherent stories from a given prompt is a challenging task in natural language processing (NLP). Traditional rule-based systems lack the flexibility and creativity required for such tasks. This project aims to address this challenge by using a deep learning-based approach to generate stories that are contextually relevant and grammatically correct.
3. Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of pairs of writing prompts and corresponding stories. The data is split into three sets:
•	Training Data: Used to train the Seq2Seq model.
•	Validation Data: Used to tune the model and prevent overfitting.
•	Test Data: Used to evaluate the model's performance.
The dataset is stored in text files, with each line containing a prompt or a story.
4. Methodology
4.1 Preprocessing
1.	Data Loading:
o	The load_data function reads the source (prompts) and target (stories) text files.
o	Data is split into training, validation, and test sets.
2.	Tokenization:
o	A Tokenizer from TensorFlow's Keras API is used to convert text into sequences of integers.
o	The tokenizer is fitted on both the source and target texts to build a vocabulary.
o	Special tokens like <OOV> (out-of-vocabulary) are added to handle unknown words.
3.	Padding Sequences:
o	The sequences are padded to a fixed length (max_seq_length) using pad_sequences.
o	This ensures that all input sequences have the same length, which is required for training the model.
4.	Input and Output Preparation:
o	For the decoder, the target sequences are shifted by one position to create the input and output pairs.
	Input to the decoder: target_padded[:, :-1]
	Output from the decoder: target_padded[:, 1:]

4.2 Model Architecture
The Seq2Seq model with attention is implemented as follows:
1.	Encoder:
o	Takes the padded source sequences as input.
o	An embedding layer converts the integer sequences into dense vectors of fixed size (embedding_dim).
o	An LSTM layer processes the embedded sequences and returns the final hidden states (state_h, state_c), which capture the context of the input sequence.
2.	Decoder:
o	Takes the padded target sequences as input.
o	An embedding layer converts the sequences into dense vectors.
o	An LSTM layer processes the embedded sequences, using the encoder's final hidden states as the initial state.
3.	Attention Mechanism:
o	An attention layer is used to focus on relevant parts of the encoder's output while generating each word in the target sequence.
o	The attention output is concatenated with the decoder's LSTM output to provide additional context.
4.	Dense Layer:
o	A dense layer with a softmax activation function predicts the probability distribution over the vocabulary for each word in the sequence.
5.	Model Training:
o	The model is compiled with the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical cross-entropy loss.
o	It is trained on the padded source and target sequences for a specified number of epochs.
4.3 Postprocessing
1.	Story Generation:
o	The generate_story function takes a prompt as input.
o	The prompt is tokenized and padded to match the input length expected by the model.
o	The decoder input is initialized with a start token (<start>).
o	The model predicts the next word in the sequence iteratively until the end token (<end>) is generated or the maximum sequence length is reached.
2.	Text Conversion:
o	The generated sequence of integers is converted back into text using the tokenizer's sequences_to_texts method.
3.	Flask API:
o	A Flask API is created to expose the story generation functionality.
o	The API accepts a JSON payload with a prompt and returns the generated story as a JSON response.

9. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the use of a Seq2Seq model with attention for story generation. The model is capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant stories from writing prompts. The Flask API provides an easy-to-use interface for real-time story generation. While the current implementation is effective, there is significant scope for improvement in terms of dataset quality, model architecture, and deployment.
