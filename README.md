AI-Based Story Generation Using Writing Prompts
Project Overview
This project leverages advanced AI models, such as GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformers), to automatically generate creative and coherent stories based on user-provided writing prompts. The model is trained on a large dataset of writing prompts and corresponding human-written stories, enabling it to produce contextually relevant narratives across various genres. The final model is deployed using Streamlit, providing an interactive and user-friendly interface for story generation.

Features
AI-Powered Story Generation: Generates creative and engaging stories from user-provided prompts.

Large Dataset Training: Trained on a comprehensive dataset of writing prompts and human-written stories.

Interactive Interface: Built with Streamlit for an intuitive and seamless user experience.

Model Efficiency: Supports saving and loading the trained model for reuse and deployment.

Customizable: Users can experiment with different prompts to generate unique stories.

Dataset
The project uses the Writing Prompts Dataset from Kaggle, which consists of writing prompts paired with human-generated stories. The dataset is divided into three subsets: training, validation, and test sets.

Dependencies
The project uses the following Python libraries:

torch: For deep learning model training and inference.

transformers: For using pre-trained transformer models like GPT.

streamlit: For building the interactive web application.

numpy: For numerical computations.

pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

tqdm: For progress bars during training.

scikit-learn: For evaluation metrics (if needed).

Model Training
To train the AI model, run the following command:

bash
Copy
python train.py
Training Process
Data Loading: The script loads the dataset from the provided files.

Model Training: A transformer-based architecture is used to train the model on the writing prompts and corresponding stories.

Model Saving: The trained model is saved as model.pth for future use.

Running the Streamlit Application
To launch the interactive Streamlit application, run:

bash
Copy
streamlit run app.py
Streamlit Interface
Input: Users can enter a writing prompt in the provided text box.

Output: The AI-generated story is displayed in real-time.

Usage
Start the Application: Run the Streamlit app using the command above.

Enter a Prompt: Provide a writing prompt in the input field.

Generate a Story: The AI will generate a narrative based on the provided prompt.

Explore: Experiment with different prompts to see the variety of stories the AI can create.

Model Saving & Loading
Saving: The trained model is saved as model.pth after training.

Loading: The model is loaded in app.py before generating stories.

Future Enhancements
Fine-Tuning: Fine-tune the model on specific genres or writing styles.

User Feedback: Incorporate user feedback to improve story quality.

Multi-Language Support: Extend the model to generate stories in multiple languages.

Advanced Features: Add options for controlling story length, tone, or character development.
