AI-Based Meme Generator
This project is an AI-powered meme generator that uses the Meme900k dataset to create memes based on user input. The application leverages a deep learning model to generate captions and overlays them on randomly selected meme templates. The project is built using TensorFlow, Keras, and Streamlit for the web interface.

Introduction
The AI-Based Meme Generator is a fun and interactive application that allows users to generate memes by providing a text input. The application uses a pre-trained deep learning model to predict a caption based on the user's input and overlays it on a randomly selected meme template from the Meme900k dataset.

Features
AI-Generated Captions: The model generates captions based on user input using a deep learning model trained on the Meme900k dataset.

Random Meme Templates: The application randomly selects a meme template from the dataset to overlay the generated caption.

Streamlit Web Interface: The application is built using Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use web interface for generating and saving memes.

Custom Font Styling: The meme text is styled with a bold, capitalized, and outlined effect using the "Impact" font.

Dataset
The project uses the Meme900k dataset, which includes the following files:

captions.txt: Contains captions for the meme images.

captions_test.txt: Test set captions.

captions_val.txt: Validation set captions.

captions_train.txt: Training set captions.

templates.txt: Contains meme templates.

images/: Folder containing meme images.

The dataset is used to train the deep learning model and to provide meme templates for the application.

Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-meme-generator.git
cd ai-meme-generator
Install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy
pip install tensorflow keras pandas numpy pillow streamlit
Download the Meme900k dataset:

Ensure you have the following files in the memes900k folder:

captions.txt

captions_test.txt

captions_val.txt

captions_train.txt

templates.txt

images/ folder containing meme images.

Run the Streamlit app:

bash
Copy
streamlit run dep.py
Usage
Enter a Meme Idea: On the Streamlit web interface, enter a text input in the provided text box.

Generate Meme: Click the "Generate Meme" button to create a meme with an AI-generated caption.

View and Save: The generated meme will be displayed on the screen, and you can save it as generated_meme.jpg.

Code Structure
app.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for training the deep learning model using the Meme900k dataset.

dep.py: Python script for the Streamlit web application that generates memes using the trained model.

meme_generator.h5: Pre-trained model file used by the Streamlit app to generate captions.

Key Functions in dep.py:
load_meme_model(): Loads the pre-trained model.

generate_meme(user_input): Generates a meme based on the user's input.

wrap_text(): Wraps text to fit within the meme image.

draw_stylized_text(): Draws stylized text on the meme image.
